# Development Process

## 1. Project Planning and Requirements Gathering

- Define the scope and objectives of the MEDCONNECT Medical Record System.
- Gather requirements from stakeholders, including healthcare providers, administrators, and patients.
- Create a project plan outlining tasks, timelines, and team member responsibilities.

## 2. Frontend Development

- Design the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Implement the frontend components for patient demographics, medical history, appointment scheduling, clinical notes, diagnostic imaging, medication management, and billing.
- Conduct usability testing to ensure a user-friendly experience.

## 3. Backend Development

- Choose the backend technology (in this case, Python with Flask) to handle data processing and business logic.
- Create routes and APIs to handle frontend requests and interact with the database.
- Implement database management using CSV for patient records and other relevant data.

## 4. Integration and Testing

- Integrate the frontend and backend components to create a fully functional web application.
- Perform unit testing on the front and back end to identify and fix any issues or bugs.
- Conduct integration testing to ensure seamless communication between the front and back end.

## 5. Deployment Preparation

- Set up the server environment for hosting the web application. This may involve configuring the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and installing necessary dependencies (e.g., Python, Flask).
- Install and configure the CSV database management system on the server.

## 6. Final Testing and Debugging

- Conduct thorough testing of the web application on the server to ensure it works as expected.
- Address any server-specific issues that may arise during testing.

## 7. Security Measures

- Implement security measures to protect sensitive patient data, such as data encryption, secure login authentication, and role-based access controls.
- Conduct security testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and mitigate potential security risks.

## 8. Documentation

- Document the entire development process, including design choices, implementation details, and instructions on how to run and maintain the web application.

# Running the Web Application on the Server

To run the MEDCONNECT Medical Record System web application on a server, follow these steps:

1. **Server Setup**: Ensure that the server environment meets the minimum requirements, including the necessary operating system, Python, Flask, and other dependencies.

2. **Code Deployment**: Transfer the frontend and backend code to the server. You can use version control tools like Git to manage the codebase.

3. **Configure Web Server**: Set up the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to handle incoming HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate backend routes.

4. **Database Setup**: Configure the CSV database management system on the server and import any existing patient data.

5. **Run the Backend**: Start the backend Flask application using the following command:

   ```bash
   python app.py
